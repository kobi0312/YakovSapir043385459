# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid, with one player using "X" and the other using "O". The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Players take turns placing their symbols on the grid.
- **Win detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won or when the game ends in a draw.
- **Responsive design**: The game interface is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface with visual feedback for player moves and game status.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the game.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Click on any empty square on the grid to place your symbol (X or O).
3. Players take turns until one player aligns three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or the game ends in a draw.
4. The game will announce the winner or a draw. You can restart the game by refreshing the page.
